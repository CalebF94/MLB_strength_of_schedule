## How It Was Made:
I created python scripts to collect, clean, and format season and game level data that was scraped from https://www.baseball-reference.com/. Following data collection, I analyzed the data in a jupyter notebook where I completed data manipulation, cleaning, and visualization to explore the data and to determine whether the Cubs had the toughest opening schedule. 

## Optimizations:
To improve performance and readabilty, I created separate functions for different data scraping tasks. I also modularized my python scripts to clearly delineate different data gathering and cleaning processes.

## Lessons Learned:
This was one of my first data analysis projects done entirely in python, so I learned a lot. One of the biggest challenges was the organization of the project as a whole. Learning how to python environments and properly organize python scripts and notebooks will be a valuable skill as I continue to work in python.
